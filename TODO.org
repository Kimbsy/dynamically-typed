* Things to do:
** DONE come up with a data structure for commands
** DONE track progress towards commands
** DONE be able to clear all commands with space
** DONE display commands and progress
** DONE commands move player
** DONE gravity
** DONE platforms
** DONE friction
** DONE music
** DONE level reset
** DONE design enough levels
*** first 9 ideas sketched out
** DONE player can only jump while landed
** DONE walls
*** is this just another collider for platforms?
*** or maybe just a check in the existing collider to determine orientation
** DONE player can't go through world bounds
** DONE level goal areas
** DONE end level transition
** DONE turning should change current x vel
** DONE credits scene
** DONE menu scene
** DONE player animations
** DONE add fireworks to credits scene
** DONE command pickup sprite
** DONE FIX FONT ISSUE
*** current font only supported on linux, make sure we have a monospaced font in all OSes
*** gonna need to make command display be in terms of font dimensions, not hard coded
** DONE command completion animation
** DONE reset should be a command
** DONE design teaching reset
** DONE game intro
** DONE prettify menu scene
** DONE clean up print statements
** DONE prettify platforms
** DONE design more levels
** DONE dive command
** TODO game end
** TODO player visibly changing as levels progress
** TODO quit to menu command
** TODO command failed animation
*** for if you grab when you shouldn't or jump in mid air
** TODO sound effects
*** DONE jump
*** DONE dash
*** DONE turn
*** DONE level complete
*** DONE new command
*** DONE dive
*** TODO grab
*** TODO firework pop?
** TODO SORT THAT SOUND CRASHING BUG
*** some files seem to crash the sound engine
*** maybe just keep making them until they work?
*** are they working across machines?
** TODO kepress animation underlay thingy
** TODO graphics settings? (option to remove animation underlay thingy)
** TODO resizable screen
** TODO submit game
** TODO game submission page
*** TODO screenshots
*** TODO description
*** TODO controls?
*** TODO build instructions
*** TODO source code

* UPDATE QUIP
** DONE made a change to add non-collision functions
** DONE made a change to pass `b` sprites into collide-fn-a functions
** DONE made a change to add identity update-fn for buttons
** DONE made a change to add identity update-fn for text sprites
** TODO scene transition delay (so we can see buttons unpress)
** TODO a generalised way of creating delayed actions
** TODO a way of defining and applying tweens to sprites
** TODO a way of defining coeffects for the state in colliders
